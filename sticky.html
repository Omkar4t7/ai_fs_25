    Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[46][47] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[48] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[49][50] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied until 1995.[51] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School.[52][53][54][55][56] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[57]

In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic supercapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[58][59] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[54][52][60] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[61][42] The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford.[60] In response, Musk said he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B. According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time.[62]
